Here's a link to the lesson 1 assignment MA has been working on... she's not far with it, but is this the right/a good idea? [MA's personal replit reworking lesson 1 assignment](https://replit.com/@Mary-AliceAlice/Javascript-Basics-Assignment-MA-Oct-2023-testing)


Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers.
THIS IS TRASH I WAS LOOKIUNG AT WRONG ASSIGNMENT/TOM
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

Write a function that returns the difference of two numbers.

const subtract = (a, b) => {
  return a - b;
};


Write a function that returns the product of two numbers.

const multiply = (a, b) => {
  return a * b;
};


Write a function that returns the quotient of two numbers.

const divide = (a, b) => {
  return a / b;
};


Write a function that increments a number by 1 and returns the result.

const increment = (num) => {
  num++; 
  return num;
};


Write a function that takes an integer and returns its decimal equivalent.

const decimal = (num) => {
  return parseFloat(num);
};


Write a function that takes two numbers and returns the remainder of the first number divided by the second number.

const remainder = (num1, num2) => {
  return num1 % num2;
};


Write a function that returns the square of a number.

const square = (num) => {
  return num * num;
};


Write a function that returns the square root of a number.

const sqrt = (num) => {
  return Math.sqrt(num);
};


Write a function that takes two numbers and returns the power of the first number raised to the second number.

const power = (num1, num2) => {
  return Math.pow(num1, num2);
};
